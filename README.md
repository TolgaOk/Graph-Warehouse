## Warehouse graph experiments

#### Under development!

This repository involves a few experiments on Warehouse environment as well as implementations of [Graph-DQN](http://spirl.info/2019/camera-ready/spirl_camera-ready_07.pdf) and [Relational-RL](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HkxaFoC9KQ). Environment is taken from the Graph-DQN paper. We used A2C as baseline on all of the experiments.
